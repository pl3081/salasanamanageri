This was a rushed school project so there is a lot of issues that Im working on.

Known issues:

- Added passwords are stored in plaintext.
- If the password file has a space in front of the text, the whole program breaks.
- The code is super rushed and needs to be rewritten.
- Added passwords aren't updating without restarting the program.
- Registering closes the program after it's finished.
